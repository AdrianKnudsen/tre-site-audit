# Claude Skill Version (Legacy)

This directory contains an alternative Claude Code skill-based implementation of the website auditor.

## Files

- **SKILL.md** - Claude Code skill documentation
- **site-audit.md** - Skill command definition with allowed tools
- **pre-audit.py** - Python script for automated HTML analysis

## Note

This is a legacy/alternative version. The main application now runs as an integrated Node.js/Express webapp located in the root directory.

See `/server.js` and `/lib/` for the current implementation.
